# wxpython is a requirement, however it is not easy to pip install, you have to install libraries onto the system
# using apt-get and such on Ubuntu ahead of time, so that wxpython will work.  I'll try to itemize out all the
# installation details for the prerequisites here, even though this isn't the actual best place for it.
# First off, my installation:
#   Ubuntu 17.10
#   System Python 3.6.3
#   I use Python 3's built in venv to create a virtual environment for my pip installations based on 3.6.3

# Most of the prerequisites can be installed directly through apt-get.
# I will itemize them here.  I have not verified which, or all, of these are actually necessary, but I'll try to
# update the list when I get a chance to verify that.  The list comes from the install guide at:
# https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst
#   - dpkg-dev
#   - build-essential
#   - python3.6-dev # use appropriate Python version here
#   - libjpeg-dev
#   - libtiff-dev
#   - libsdl1.2-dev
#   - libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
#   - libnotify-dev
#   - freeglut3
#   - freeglut3-dev
#   - libsm-dev
#   - libgtk-3-dev
#   - libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev
#   - libgtk2.0-dev (if using GTK2 - which I don't think I am)
#   - libwebkitgtk-dev (if using GTK2 - which I don't think I am)
#   - libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev (newer version, if available)
#   - libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev (newer version, if available)
#   - libsdl2-dev (newer version, if available)

# There is one that was killed off in Ubuntu 16.10 that is still needed by the binary wheel installation of wxPython
# So you have to go download it and install it manually:
#   - Download URL: http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/libp/libpng/libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb
#   - Install through Software Center, or: sudo dpkg -i /path/to/downloads/libpng12-0_1.2.54-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

# Then you need to actually download and install the prebuilt binary wxPython package for my system
#   - Get into your virtual environment
#   - Change the filename in the following URL to match your System, wxPython, and Python version
#   - pip install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk2/ubuntu-16.04/wxPython-4.0.0b2-cp36-cp36mu-linux_x86_64.whl wxPython

# On MacOS, I also had trouble getting it running.  I found out that when I create a virtual environment, I need to make
# sure that the base installation is a "framework" build.  This isn't hard to do with pyenv, just add an environment
# variable when installing the base version, then create a virtual environment off of it
# $ env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 3.6.3
# $ pyenv virtualenv 3.6.3 eplaunch3env
# To debug, verify you have a framework build using the sysconfig package:
# from sysconfig import get_config_var
# if get_config_var("PYTHONFRAMEWORK"): # then you have a framework build (it returns the string 'Python' for me)

# Here are the *actual* PyPi dependencies that are listed in this file
